{"name":"Resinsight","tagline":"3D viewer and post processing of reservoir models","body":"# ResInsight\r\n\r\nResInsight is an open source, cross-platform 3D visualization and post processing tool for reservoir models and simulations. The system also constitutes a framework for further development and support for new data sources and visualization methods, e.g. additional solvers, seismic data, CSEM, geomechanics, and more. \r\n\r\nThe user interface is tailored for efficient interpretation of reservoir simulation data with specialized visualizations of properties, faults and wells. It enables easy handling of a large number of realizations and calculation of statistics. To be highly responsive, ResInsight exploits multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Integration with GNU Octave enables powerful and flexible result manipulation and computations. Derived results can be returned to ResInsight for further handling and visualization. Eventually, derived and computed properties can be directly exported to Eclipse input formats for further simulation cycles and parameter studies.\r\n\r\nThe main input data is *.GRID and *.EGRID files along with their *.INIT and restart files *.XNNN and *.UNRST. ResInsight also supports selected parts of Eclipse input files and can read grid information and corresponding cell property data sets.\r\n\r\nResInsight has been co-developed by Statoil ASA, Ceetron Solutions AS, and Ceetron AS with the aim to provide a versatile tool for professionals who need to visualize and process reservoir models. The software is copyrighted by Ceetron and Statoil and licensed under GPL 3+. See COPYING for details.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nResInsight uses the Ensambles/ert library to access Eclipse result files, and the two projects collaborates closely. The source code of the approved ert library version is embedded in the ResInsight source code tree, making downloading and building simple.\r\nResInsight also features an interface to Octave for retrieval of data from ResInsight, processing using Octave, and communication of data back into ResInsight for further handling and visualization.\r\n\r\nOctave : [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)\r\n\r\nEnsembles/ert : [https://github.com/Ensembles/ert](https://github.com/Ensembles/ert)\r\n\r\n### Supported Platforms\r\nResInsight is designed cross-platform from the start. Efforts have been made to ensure that code will compile and run on Linux and Windows platforms. Tested platforms are currently 64 bit RHEL5, RHEL6 and Windows 7.\r\n\r\nThere has been attempts to make ResInsight build and run on OSX as well, but the tweaks needed (submitted by Roland Kaufmann) is not yet incorporated. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nAn online [ Users Guide ](Documentation/UsersGuide/UsersGuide.md) with some reference content is \r\n[ here ](Documentation/UsersGuide/UsersGuide.md)\r\n\r\n### Source Code\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/OPM/ResInsight.git\r\n\r\n### Contribution\r\nContributions are very welcome, although it might take some time for the team to accept pull requests that is not in the main line of the projects focus. \r\n\r\nPlease use the dev branch for contributions and pull requests, as it is the branch dedicated to the day to day development. \r\n\r\nThe master branch is supposed to be stable, and is updated when we want to publish a new stable release.\r\n\r\nRelease branches that might pop up are dedicated bug fix branches for the release in question.\r\n\r\n### Building ResInsight\r\n\r\nSee [ Build Instructions ] (BuildInstructions.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
