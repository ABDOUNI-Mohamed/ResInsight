We are happy to announce a new development project for ResInsight named **Flow Diagnostics**, which will be delivered to Statoil Petroleum AS in 2017.

The main goal of this project is to implement selected functionality of the flow diagnostics module from the **The Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox â€“ MRST** developed by SINTEF. Flow diagnostics capability will allow for interactive numerical flow experiments for probing a reservoir model, establish connections and basic volume estimates, and quickly provide a qualitative picture of the flow patterns in the reservoir.

In addition, plotting of curves based on data from Eclipse Summary files will be implemented.

See [Roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/roadmap) for more info.
