#The source code for ERT is located in :

cd /home/builder/src/ert/devel/

# We only use libecl and libutil
# libutil must be built first

# First you might want to check what has happened since last update:
cd libutil
svn log -r BASE:HEAD
cd ../libecl
svn log -r BASE:HEAD
cd ..

# Then update and build the code:

# using cmake

svn up
cmake-gui

# Enter the following in the gui:
# Source code: /home/builder/src/ert/devel/
# Binaries: /home/builder/src/ert/ErtCmakeBuild

# Then press configure, and edit the following variables:
# BLAS_LIBRARY: /usr/lib64/libblas.so.3
# INSTALL_ROOT: /home/builder/Projects/ResInsight/ThirdParty/Ert/

# then press Configure and then Generate
# at the prompt:

cd /home/builder/src/ert/ErtCmakeBuild
make clean
make

# make your copy of the library editable by checking it out
#p4 edit -c default /home/builder/Projects/ResInsight/ThirdParty/Ert/...

rm -r /home/builder/Projects/ResInsight/ThirdParty/Ert/ecl/*
rm -r /home/builder/Projects/ResInsight/ThirdParty/Ert/util/*
rm -r /home/builder/Projects/ResInsight/ThirdParty/Ert/geometry/*
rm -r /home/builder/Projects/ResInsight/ThirdParty/Ert/well/*

make install

# Then check in if appropriate
# Finished.

# Old build system using SCons.
# At that time the installation directories was
# called libecl and libutil, not ecl and util so this must be taken into
# accont if this approach is tested

# First clean up

cd libutil
scons -c
rm -r include
rm -r lib
cd ..

cd libecl
scons -c
rm -r include
rm -r lib

# update and build
svn up

cd libecl
scons -k

# Copy the new lib files and includes into our repository
